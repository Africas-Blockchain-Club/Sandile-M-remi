## My path to become a proficient blockchain developer

1. I was drawn to the blockchain's entire decentralisation and transparency concept when I first joined. 

2. In order to reinforce my learning, I'll start with basic smart contracts and gradually increase their complexity and pace.

## Repo structure: 

1. Every one of my smart contracts will have a folder with an explanation in a README
2. Each of those folders will be in a folder labelled "beginner, intermediate, etc." to differentiate the projects' levels. 

**NB: Anticipate some comments as it aids in my review of what I've learned.**
